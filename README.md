# Turing's Case
**Game developed for the Computer Science Course at PUC-PR.**

## Project Introduction(Portuguese): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmZKDKjc4X0
## The Project  
Our assignment was to build a simple terminal game where players would use induction and boolean logic to solve a case. However, I decided to create something fancier. I hope you enjoy it!

## "Unorthodox Code" comment
This project was developed in a single crunch session; I had about a day and a half to complete both the graphics and the code, that is essentially what it is saying.
