## The Project  
Our assignment was to build a <a href="https://github.com/romm27/detetive">simple terminal game</a> where players would use induction and boolean logic to solve a case. However, I decided to create something fancier. I hope you enjoy it!

## "Unorthodox Code" comment
This project was developed in a single crunch session; I had about a day and a half to complete both the graphics and the code, that is essentially what it is saying.

## Graphics
The game was developed inside the Unity Engine which is 3D capable, however, it is technically a 2D game made using images rendered in <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1840/Source_Filmmaker/">Source Film Maker</a>.
