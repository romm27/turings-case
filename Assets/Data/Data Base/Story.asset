  - 'In the tranquil suburbs of 1970''s Chicago, the Turings embodied a tight-knit
    unit. Ann, their vibrant 13-year-old, brought boundless energy and laughter to
    their home. Caroline, a 43-year-old lawyer, exuded nurturing warmth.

    Giovanni,
    46, a steadfast police officer, safeguarded the city. They were a classic happy
    family. However, everything was about to change.

    On March 6th, 1977, a telephone
    call resonated within the residence of the Turing family. The caller identifies
    as law enforcement, conveying the distressing information that Giovanni Turing
    has been discovered deceased.'
  - 'The weight of despair settled as the authorities, after a brief inquiry, attributed
    his passing to suicide. The family, engulfed in devastation, found themselves
    unable to reconcile with this harrowing loss, forever burdened by the incomprehensible
    tragedy.

    Fast forward to the year 1992. Ann remains unable to accept the
    official narrative surrounding her father''s demise.'
  - "Despite the police having closed the case, attributing it to suicide, Ann is
    convinced that her father, Giovanni Turing, didn\u2019t have any reasons to have
    done that to himself.\r\nThe family firmly believed that the government was responsible
    for Giovanni's demise.\r\nMotivated by this persistent doubt, Ann managed to
    save enough money to hire the famous detective William Rock. Her sole aim: to
    conclusively dissolve the perpetual agony haunting her family, once and for all."
  - 'William Rock, a prominent in the world of investigative brilliance, stands as
    an exemplar of deductive proficiency and unwavering determination. His reputation
    precedes him, adorned with tales of unraveling the most enigmatic mysteries that
    stymied conventional minds.

    With a keen eye for detail and a relentless
    pursuit of truth, Rock embodies the essence of a seasoned detective, his sharp
    intellect matched only by his tenacity to unearth the hidden threads that bind
    the most perplexing cases.'
